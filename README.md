The `Core` folder contains the JavaScript classes. There is one class for each one of the concepts in the ontology (Contract, Party, Obligation, Power, Asset, Event, Role, and LegalPosition). These classes are transalted from the Java code generated by the Umple tool. The `Events.js` and `InternalEvent.js` files implement the Publishâ€“subscribe pattern used to track events in the runtime.

The `Ontology` folder contains resources related to the ontolgy. The `ontology.ump` file is the umple code of Symboleo ontology, it defines both the relations and state machine of each entity. The `Symboleo.ecore` file is the Eclipse Ecore equivalent of the Umple description of the ontology. The `Symboleo.aird` is the Eclipse Sirius class diagram description (visualized at the top of README). Finally, the `Symboleo.genmodel` file is the Eclipse GenModel representation also generated from the Ecore file.
