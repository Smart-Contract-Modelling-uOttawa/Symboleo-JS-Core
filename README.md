# symboleo-js-core
This repository contains core classes of the JavaScript implementation of the Symboleo ontology.  

![Ontology-EMF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Smart-Contract-Modelling-uOttawa/Symboleo-JS-Core/main/ontology/Ontology-EMF.png)

The `Core` folder contains the JavaScript classes. There is one class for each one of the concepts in the ontology (Contract, Party, Obligation, Power, Asset, Event, Role, and LegalPosition). These classes are translated from the Java code generated by the Umple tool. The `Events.js` and `InternalEvent.js` files implement the Publishâ€“subscribe pattern used to track events in the runtime. The `Predicates.js` file includes the predicate methods (happens*) that can be used in a JavaScript implementation of a Symboleo contract.

The `Ontology` folder contains resources related to the ontolgy. The `ontology.ump` file is the Umple code of Symboleo ontology, it defines both the relations and state machine of each entity. The `Symboleo.ecore` file is the Eclipse Ecore equivalent of the Umple description of the ontology. The `Symboleo.aird` is the Eclipse Sirius class diagram description (visualized at the top of this README). Finally, the `Symboleo.genmodel` file is the Eclipse GenModel representation also generated from the Ecore file.
